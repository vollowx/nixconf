* Nix Configuration

** Introduction

   This is my personal Nix configuration for my machines. It is based on NixOS
   and Home Manager, and is managed by Nix Flakes.

** TODOs

*** DONE Separate per machine configs under `nixos` and `home-manager`
*** DONE Bring Neovim configs back
    Note that the configs are at a separate repo now at [[https://github.com/vollowx/nvimconf][vollowx/nvimconf]].
*** DONE Separate i3 WM import to `hosts/optional`
*** DONE Add CJK, emoji and mono-space fonts
*** TODO Setup Steam and Proton at `features/games`
*** DONE Add `apple_cursor`
*** TODO Setup `distrobox`
*** DONE Setup `dunst`
*** DONE Setup `nix-ld`
    Now `nix-ld-rust` actually
*** DONE Embed `tofi` in `waybar`
    Now due to `waybar` is no longer used, this appearance has been removed.
*** TODO Setup a graphical file manager

** Instllation

   Install a minimal NixOS first, them clone this repo and run

   #+begin_src sh
   nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<hostname>
   #+end_src

   to install the configurations.

   After you've got the configured system, you can replace that with

   #+begin_src sh
   nh os switch .
   #+end_src

   for NixOS-level rebuilds, and

   #+begin_src sh
   nh home switch .
   #+end_src

   for Home Manager-level rebuilds.

   To update the system, you can run

   #+begin_src sh
   nix flake update
   #+end_src

   first, then run the above commands.
